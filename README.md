# Dummy Users App

The **Dummy Users App** is a React application built with **Vite**, **TypeScript**, and **Vitest**. It fetches a list of dummy users from the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/docs/users) and displays their full names and email addresses. When a user is clicked, their detailed information (first name, last name, email, and gender) is displayed. The application follows best practices and includes comprehensive testing with **Vitest** and **Istanbul** for 90% to 100% test coverage.
